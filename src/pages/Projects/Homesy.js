      Homesy is a platform for the German real estate marketplace that allows

      registering the property details on the Homesy platform.

      The platform takes care of pushing the property details to multiple real
      estate platforms and also streamlines the queries received on multiple
      real estate platforms to Homesyâ€™s mailbox.
