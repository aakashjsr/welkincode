          <p>
            The client is in a drop-shipping business where he was selling 40k+
            products. The problem he was running into was that quite often he
            was receiving order for products that were actually out of stock in
            his manufactureâ€™s website.
            <br />
            <br />
            The challenge was to identify such out of stock items and take them
            out from his website on a daily basis to improve customer
            experience.
